    "1. The reasoning provided by ChatGPT in the answer appears valid, given all the assumptions it states - however it's important to acknowledge how large a role the assumptions have played in the answer. It takes a frequentist approach which assumes no prior information about the probability of the coin landing on heads or tails, it uses a normal distribution to model the sampling distribution (which generally assumes a large number of samples), and takes a relatively arbitrary confidence interval of 0.05 to then produce the percentage chance.

    "2. a) Take a sample of a 100 people - 0.98 are TP, 0.2 are FN, 97.02 are TN and 1.98 are FP. Therefore chances of a TP among positive results is $0.98/2.86$ or $33.1$%. The same result can be calculated via bayes theorem. \n",
